##  How It Works

### Monthly Payment Formula

The app uses the standard amortization formula:

```
PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
```

Where:
- P = Principal (loan amount)
- r = Monthly interest rate
- n = Number of payments

### Interest Calculation

For each month:
- Interest = Remaining Balance × (Annual Rate / 12)
- Principal Payment = Monthly Payment - Interest
- New Balance = Previous Balance - Principal Payment

### Prepayment Benefits

Extra payments go directly toward principal, which:
- Reduces total interest paid
- Shortens your loan term
- Builds equity faster

## 💡 Tips for Users

- Even $50-$100 extra per month can save thousands in interest
- Making one extra payment per year (13 payments) can cut years off your loan
- The earlier you start making extra payments, the more you save
